PhD Student @ Duke University.

hi, thanks for stopping by! 

i'm valerie, a PhD student at Duke University working at the intersection of climate science and deep learning. my current research interests include: the application of physics-informed neural networks to improve climate modeling and forecasting, the role of land heterogeneity in the migration of carbon emissions, and the use of spatial downscaling to inform community resilience policies at the regional scale.

previously, i obtained my MS in Structural Engineering and Geomechanics from Stanford University. in my free time, i enjoy trying fun baking recipes, finding new coffee shops to visit, practicing pilates, and reading.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
